# SharePass Chrome Extension

## About SharePass

# Development Environment

Share accounts and subscriptions without giving your passwords away.

Everything for a Username! 
- That's right. No email addresses. No mobile phones. No remembering those pesky passwords. Just you and a username you get to choose!
- Don't worry though, we believe your private information should stay private hence there's strong authentication going on behind the scenes.

Share Accounts - Not Passwords.
- Share temporary access for 4 hours, 1 day, 7 days or 2 weeks! Perfect for a socially-distanced movie night or binge watching the latest season of your favourite TV show.
- Your accounts are encrypted and sent via an SSL secured network - no need to generate manual URLs which store your sessions on a server, just type in their username and hit SharePass!
- Sessions are stored locally on your device, meaning even we can't access your data.
